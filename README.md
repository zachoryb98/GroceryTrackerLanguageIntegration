# GroceryTrackerLanguageIntegration
This is for CS210

#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program utilizes C++ and Python to build and item-tracking system for a grocery store. It was requested to produce a list of items sold and the amount sold. Take a given item name and display the amount of that specific item sold. Then 
finally the last request was to produce a histogram of all sales data.

# What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I built a good menu, and wrote code that will be easy to understand with plenty of comments.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Something I thought of after it was too late to change was to strip the user input of special characters, and capitalize or lowercase all user before searching the list to make matches easier to find. I also could have sorted the dictionary so we could see everything in alphabetical order or by highest item sold.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are # you adding to your support network?
I didn't necessarily find the assignment hard. It was a good brain teaser, but the thing that actually caused the biggest headache was misnaming my file. I added a .txt to the name so I was having a very hard time getting the file to open. It took me a good 2 hours to figure out what I did wrong. I spent a good amount of time researching to figure out what I was doing wrong. I previously thought it was an issue with Python. I used Python Documentation, I used Microsoft documentation, I searched through stackoverflow posts, and some other miscellaneous sites that were using files in python with VS.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
There were a bunch of things that can come from this to another such as the syntax for the programming languages. We have now seen different examples of loops, conditional-statements, classes, methods and so on. This programming experience will help in any future programming courses.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program easy to read by using meaningful variable names, adding many useful comments, logic is split into smaller increments with the use of a method and switch statement, I made the menu with a switch statement so if additional functionality were required they could just add a case to the switch statement and add logic.
